# 3d U-Net Secondary Features
Resources shared as part of the paper - Improved Pancreatic Tumor Detection by Utilizing Clinically-Relevant Secondary Features

# Datasets
We use the [Medical Decathlon](http://medicaldecathlon.com/) dataset - Task 07 Pancreas & Tumour. A few cases were supplimented with additional annotations of the  pancreatic duct, common bile duct, pancreas and pancreatic tumour for this work. The new annotations and corresponding CT volumes (nifti) can be downloaded [here](http://medicaldecathlon.com/).

# Code
The approach is based on [https://github.com/wolny/pytorch-3dunet](https://github.com/wolny/pytorch-3dunet).
